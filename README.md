# Building_a_RAG_Pipeline_for_LLMs
Building a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Pipeline for LLMs involves integrating a retrieval system with a language model to enhance its responses by grounding them in external knowledge.

This project demonstrates how to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline by integrating a document retriever with a large language model (LLM) to generate context-aware responses. The approach enhances the LLM's output by grounding answers in an external knowledge base, improving accuracy and domain relevance.

# Features
Document Ingestion: Load and chunk documents using LangChain.

Embedding and Vector Store: Convert text to embeddings using HuggingFaceEmbeddings and store in FAISS.

Retrieval: Efficiently retrieve relevant chunks for a query.

Generation: Use OpenAIâ€™s ChatOpenAI model to generate responses grounded in retrieved data.

RAG Chain Integration: Combine retrieval and generation into a single seamless pipeline.

A RAG pipeline combines a retriever (which fetches relevant documents from a knowledge base) with a generator (typically a large language model like GPT) that uses the retrieved documents to produce accurate, context-aware answers. This approach improves factual accuracy, enables domain-specific knowledge integration, and supports up-to-date information retrieval.
